# Project Title: Colab-based LLM Prompting Tool

## Overview

This project aims to develop a modular Python-based tool that leverages Google Drive for creating prompts and interacting with various Large Language Model (LLM) APIs. The tool consists of core Python modules for functionality and Colab notebooks for user interaction.

## Objectives

- **Core Python Modules**: Develop standalone Python modules for setup, prompt management, and LLM API interactions
- **Colab Interface**: Provide Colab notebooks that import and utilize the core modules
- **Prompt Management**: Utilize text files containing YAML-formatted strings with Jinja templates for dynamic value insertion
- **Future Expansion**: Design the system to accommodate prompt chaining and additional features in future iterations

## System Architecture

### 1. Core Python Modules

- **setup.py**:
  - Handles environment configuration
  - Manages Google Drive mounting and directory creation
  - Validates environment and dependencies

- **prompt_manager.py**:
  - Implements prompt storage and retrieval
  - Handles YAML parsing and template rendering
  - Manages prompt versioning and validation

- **llm_api.py**:
  - Provides unified interface for LLM API interactions
  - Handles authentication and request formatting
  - Manages response processing and error handling

### 2. Colab Notebooks

- **setup.ipynb**:
  - Imports and utilizes setup.py
  - Provides interactive interface for initial configuration
  - Guides users through environment setup

- **main.ipynb**:
  - Primary user interface for the tool
  - Imports core modules for functionality
  - Provides interactive cells for prompt management and API interactions

### 3. Prompt Storage and Management

- **Prompt Files**:
  - Stored as text files in Google Drive.
  - Contain YAML-formatted strings.
  - Utilize Jinja templates for dynamic data insertion.

- **Template Rendering**:
  - Prompts are rendered within the Colab environment before being sent to the LLM APIs.
  - Supports insertion of variables and parameters at runtime.

### 4. Modular Design for Future Features

- **Extensibility**:
  - The codebase will be modular to facilitate the addition of new features like prompt chaining.
  - Allows for easy integration of new APIs and prompt processing techniques.

## Technology Stack

- **Python Modules**: Core functionality implementation
- **Google Colab**: User interface and execution environment
- **Google Drive**: Storage for modules, prompts, outputs, and configuration files
- **Jinja2**: Templating engine for rendering prompt templates
- **YAML**: Format for writing prompts with structured data
- **GitHub**: Source code repository and version control

## Workflow

1. **Setup**:
   - User opens setup.ipynb
   - Notebook imports setup.py to configure the environment
   - Core modules are verified and initialized

2. **Usage**:
   - User opens main.ipynb
   - Notebook imports necessary Python modules
   - User interacts with the system through notebook interface
   - Core functionality is handled by imported modules

3. **Development**:
   - Core functionality is developed and maintained in Python modules
   - Notebooks focus on user interface and interaction
   - Modules can be updated independently of notebooks

## Considerations

- **Security**:
  - Secure handling of API keys and authentication tokens.
  - Ensure prompts and data are protected within the user's Drive.

- **Error Handling**:
  - Robust error reporting for failed API calls or template rendering issues.

- **User Experience**:
  - Provide clear instructions and documentation within the Colab notebooks.
  - Design intuitive interfaces for interacting with prompts and APIs.

## Next Steps

- **Prototype Development**: Start building the Colab setup notebook and basic API interface.
- **Testing**: Validate the workflow with sample prompts and API calls.
- **Iteration**: Refine the design based on user feedback and testing outcomes.
