# Project Title: Colab-based LLM Prompting Tool

## Overview

This project aims to develop a Colab-based tool that leverages Google Drive for creating prompts and interacting with various Large Language Model (LLM) APIs. The tool will facilitate seamless prompt management and LLM API calls, enabling users to efficiently generate and modify prompts stored in text files.

## Objectives

- **Colab Setup Script**: Provide a Colab notebook that automates the setup process, including creating necessary folders in Google Drive and cloning source code from GitHub.
- **LLM API Interface**: Develop an interface within the Colab environment to interact with different LLM APIs.
- **Prompt Management**: Utilize text files containing YAML-formatted strings with Jinja templates for dynamic value insertion.
- **Future Expansion**: Design the system to accommodate prompt chaining and additional features in future iterations.

## System Architecture

### 1. Colab Setup Notebook

- **Purpose**: Streamlines the initial setup by automating environment configuration.
- **Features**:
  - Mounts Google Drive.
  - Creates required directories (e.g., `prompts/`, `outputs/`).
  - Clones or updates source code from a specified GitHub repository.
  - Installs necessary Python packages and dependencies.

### 2. Prompt Storage and Management

- **Prompt Files**:
  - Stored as text files in Google Drive.
  - Contain YAML-formatted strings.
  - Utilize Jinja templates for dynamic data insertion.

- **Template Rendering**:
  - Prompts are rendered within the Colab environment before being sent to the LLM APIs.
  - Supports insertion of variables and parameters at runtime.

### 3. LLM API Interface

- **API Integration**:
  - Provides a unified interface to interact with multiple LLM APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face).
  - Handles API authentication and request formatting.

- **Functionality**:
  - Sends rendered prompts to selected LLMs.
  - Receives and displays responses within the Colab notebook.
  - Logs interactions and responses for auditing and analysis.

### 4. Modular Design for Future Features

- **Extensibility**:
  - The codebase will be modular to facilitate the addition of new features like prompt chaining.
  - Allows for easy integration of new APIs and prompt processing techniques.

## Technology Stack

- **Google Colab**: Primary development and execution environment.
- **Google Drive**: Storage for prompts, outputs, and configuration files.
- **Python**: Core programming language for scripts and interface.
- **Jinja2**: Templating engine for rendering prompt templates.
- **YAML**: Format for writing prompts with structured data.
- **GitHub**: Source code repository and version control.

## Workflow

1. **Setup**:
   - User opens the Colab setup notebook.
   - Runs cells to configure the environment and setup directories.

2. **Prompt Creation**:
   - User creates or edits prompt files in Google Drive.
   - Utilizes YAML with Jinja templates to define prompts.

3. **API Interaction**:
   - User selects a prompt and specifies parameters.
   - The system renders the prompt template with provided values.
   - Sends the prompt to the chosen LLM API.

4. **Result Handling**:
   - Receives the response from the LLM.
   - Displays output within Colab.
   - Optionally saves the response to Google Drive.

## Considerations

- **Security**:
  - Secure handling of API keys and authentication tokens.
  - Ensure prompts and data are protected within the user's Drive.

- **Error Handling**:
  - Robust error reporting for failed API calls or template rendering issues.

- **User Experience**:
  - Provide clear instructions and documentation within the Colab notebooks.
  - Design intuitive interfaces for interacting with prompts and APIs.

## Next Steps

- **Prototype Development**: Start building the Colab setup notebook and basic API interface.
- **Testing**: Validate the workflow with sample prompts and API calls.
- **Iteration**: Refine the design based on user feedback and testing outcomes.
