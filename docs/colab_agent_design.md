## User Flow

- User copies a google sheet template, the template has an 'input', 'output', and 'debug' tab
- Each row in the 'input' tab has chain input 
- User opens a chain colab notebook
- Colab's first cell has input forms, that include the following: 'google sheet url',   




- User provides the url of the google sheet in the first cell of the colab notebook
